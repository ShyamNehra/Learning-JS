JavaScript Execution Context:
When we give our code to JS, Firstly "Global Execution Context(GEC)" is created, and a variale 'this' referes to the GEC. 
GEC for browser environment, Node.js environment, etc is different, and in browser, the value of 'this' -> window object
then we have "Function Execution Context" and "Eval Execution Context" (This is not as important to know much about)


Javascript is executed in two phases:
    1. Memory Creation Phase
    2. Execution Phase

1. Memory Creation Phase: Memory is allocated to all the variable declared



-----------------------------Example Code-----------------------------

let val1 = 10;
let val2 = 20;

function addNum(num1, num2){
    let total = num1 + num2
    return total;
}

let result1 = addNum(val1, val2)
let result2 = addNum(10, 70)



STEPS:
1. Global Execution -> 'this'

2. Memory Phase:
    a. val1 -> undefined
    b. val2 -> undefined
    c. addNum -> defination
    d. result1 -> undefined
    e. result2 -> undefined

3. Execution Phase:
    a. val1 <- 10
    b. val2 <- 20
    c. addNum have nothing to execute
    d. result1 needs addNum, now addNum will create its own Executional Context(new variable environment + execution thread), where Memory Phase and Execution phase will now execute for 'addNum'
            d-1. Memory phase
                val1 -> undefined
                val2 -> undefined
                total -> undefined

            d-2. Execution phase
                num1 -> 10
                num2 -> 20
                total -> 30

                now the result - total will be passed to Global Execution Context
                and this subExecutional Context will be deleted
    e. we got the value of result1 = 30
    f. similarly result2 will be executed
